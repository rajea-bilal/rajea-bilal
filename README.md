### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently attending a full stack development bootcamp which will conclude in July '22.
- I'm a busy mother of 3 which means I have to find time early in the mornings and late at night to make this transition into tech a reality :)
- I'm learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, PHP, SQL. 
- I'm documenting my learning journey on Twitter and Linkedin. 
- In terms of projects we are creating webpages with HTML & CSS at the moment. Next step would be to add interactivity to the sites once we get to JavaScript :) 
- You can reach me at rajea.bilal@gmail.com

Fun Fact: I wear a face veil :)
