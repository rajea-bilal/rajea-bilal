### Hi there 👋

- Currently attending a full stack development bootcamp which will conclude in July '22.
- A busy mother of 3 which means I have to find time early in the mornings and late at night to make this transition into tech a reality :)
- Learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, PHP, SQL. 
- Documenting my learning journey on Twitter and Linkedin. 
- Some of the projects we are creating - webpages with HTML & CSS at the moment. Next step would be to add interactivity to the sites once we get to JavaScript :) 
- You can reach me at rajea.bilal@gmail.com

Fun Fact: I wear a face veil :)
